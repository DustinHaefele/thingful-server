##ToDO 

Implement a basic authentication middleware to 
use for protecting endpoints.

The GET /api/things endpoint should remain public.

The GET /api/things/:thing_id endpoint 
should be protected by basic auth.

The GET /api/things/:thing_id/reviews endpoint 
should be protected by basic auth.

The POST /api/reviews endpoint should be protected 
by basic auth and automatically assign a user_id.
